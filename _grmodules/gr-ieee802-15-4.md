- The O-QPSK PHY encapsulated in a hierarchical block.
- A block that implements the Rime communication stack. Rime is a lightweight communication stack designed for Wireless Sensor Networks and is part of the Contiki Operating System.
- A transceiver flow graph with USRP <-> PHY <-> MAC <-> Network layer (Rime) <-> UDP Socket / APP which resembles pretty well the ISO/OSI structure.
- A sample application which visualizes sensor values. The application shows how easy it is to connect an external program to the flow graph by using Socket PDU blocks.
- An IEEE 802.15.4 and Rime dissector for Wireshark.

Some interesting properties:
- Packets can be piped to Wireshark.
- The complete physical modulation is done with plain GNU Radio blocks.
- It is interoperable with TelosB sensor motes.
- It is interoperable with Contiki.
- It uses a block to tag packet bursts with tx_sob and tx_eob tags. This tags are understood by the UHD blocks and allow fast switching between transmission and reception.
