The Comprehensive GNU Radio Archive (CGRAN) is a list and summary of projects
that use GNU Radio and can be installed with PyBOMBS. Although there are
exceptions, most of the projects listed here are known as out-of-tree (OOT)
modules) because they are not officially a part of the GNU Radio source tree.

The list is generated by the following steps:
1. Parse PyBOMBS lightweight recipes (lwrs) for GNU Radio projects
2. Fetch/update code from source pointed to by lwr
3. Read project manifest file and generate a corresponding yaml file
4. Feed yaml files in to Jekyll and the Liquid templating system to generate
these pages

If a project is missing from the list, send a pull request to add an lwr to
PyBOMBS. If there is already a recipe in PyBOMBS and the project does not show
up for 30 minutes file an issue at https://github.com/gnuradio/grist.
